Econometric modeling of volatility and option pricing applied to the CAC 40 index.

# Volatility Modeling and Option Pricing on the CAC 40

## Project Overview
This project explores the role of econometric volatility modeling in the pricing of European options.
Using daily returns of the CAC 40 index, we estimate conditional volatility models and incorporate
them into the Black–Scholes pricing framework.

The goal is to illustrate the limitations of constant volatility assumptions and to show how
time series econometrics can improve financial pricing models.

## Methodology
- Construction of daily logarithmic returns of the CAC 40
- Preliminary statistical analysis and visualization
- Econometric modeling of volatility using GARCH-type models
- Volatility forecasting
- Option pricing using the Black–Scholes model
- Comparison between constant and conditional volatility pricing

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- statsmodels, arch
- matplotlib, scipy

## Status
Project in progres
